      "1. \"Cultural Capital and Scholarly Achievement\": This experiment can focus on whether and how cultural capital impacts scholarly achievement. The survey could ask about students' reading habits, arts engagement, and other forms of cultural exposure, and compare this data to their academic performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"The Influence of Social Media on Political Participation\": This research could explore the relationship between social media use and political involvement. The survey could ask questions about various social media habits and the respondents' involvement in political activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"Income Inequality and Mental Health\": This could involve studying the relationship between perceived income inequality and mental health outcomes. Survey questions might address respondents' subjective perception of their socio-economic status and ask about their mental wellbeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"The Impact of Gender Role Stereotypes on Career Choices\": This research question could investigate how gender role stereotypes influence individual's career choices. Surveys could include questions about respondents' career paths and their perceptions of gender roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. \"Perception of Crime based on Race and Ethnicity\": This topic could explore how people perceive the likelihood of crime based on race and ethnicity. Survey respondents could be given scenarios and asked to assess the potential criminality of individuals featuring different racial and ethnic backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. \"Acculturation and Mental Health among Immigrants\": This research could investigate how the acculturation process impacts the mental health of immigrants. Surveys could ask about experiences of cultural change and mental health indicators.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. \"Effects of Educational Homogamy on Relationship Satisfaction\": Investigate whether relationships where both partners have similar educational levels are more satisfying than relationships where there's a disparity. Surveys could ask respondents about their education level and their partners, and their relationship satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. \"Impact of Neighborhood Characteristics on Societal Involvement\": This could involve studying how the characteristics of someone's residential area influence their involvement in social and civic activities. Surveys would ask about respondents' involvement in various activities and their perceptions of their neighborhoods.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. \"Societal Changes and Views on Aging\": This experiment can focus on societal changes (like technological advancement) and how they impact views on aging. Surveys could ask about respondents' perceptions and attitudes towards older adults, alongside their use and understanding of technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. \"Social Stratification and Environmental Consciousness\": Study the correlation between social stratification and environmental consciousness. Surveys could ask respondents to rate their socio-economic status, and their environmental behaviors and attitudes. \n",

      "\n",
      "When we talk about \"cultural capital\", we refer to non-financial social assets that promote social mobility beyond economic means. Pierre Bourdieu, a prominent French sociologist, introduced and extensively explored this concept. It can include knowledge, skills, education - essentially intellectual possessions a person acquires, through personal cultivation or one's upbringing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given this topic's definition, the sociological premises of the \"Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction\" theory by Bourdieu will serve as relevant theoretical framework. This theory posits that the cultural capital of a family can significantly impact a person’s educational success. The idea here is that parents provide their children with cultural capital, transmitting the attitudes and knowledge that help the middle and upper classes to succeed. If we take this as our foundation, we can hypothesize that students who enjoy greater cultural exposure in the form of arts engagement, diverse reading habits, and varied extracurricular activities will boast higher academic achievements.\n",
      "\n",
      "To translate this topic into a research question for our survey, we might consider: \"What is the relationship between a student's cultural capital, as measured by their arts engagement, reading habits, and exposure to cultural activities, and their academic performance?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "However, in formulating our research question and designing our survey, we need to consider several important factors. First and foremost, we should consider ethics and respect the privacy and anonymity of our respondents. Never should we inquire about any personal information that isn't directly relevant to our research. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another critical consideration is to ensure the validity of our research by creating clear, unbiased questions. The questions must be constructed as objectively as possible, removing any potential prejudice or assumption. For example, we should not assume that attending an art exhibit directly improves academic performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In writing your survey for this topic, you might want to include questions about a student's involvement in various forms of arts (music, theatre, fine arts), their reading habits (kind of books, hours spent reading), and their engagement in cultural activities (trips, visits to museums). You will also track their academic performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recent science around this topic includes Susan Dumais' 2006 research exploring how involvement in extracurricular activities, particularly those defined as 'highbrow', such as Youth orchestra or Film Club, had a significant beneficial impact on academic achievement. \n",
      "\n",
      "The analytical tool of regression can be useful in analyzing survey data for this study. It can isolate and inspect the relationship between cultural capital and academic achievement, adjusting the impact of other variables like parental education, income, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, while it's intriguing to discern how cultural capital might impact scholarly achievement, it's equally important to remember that no single survey or study can definitively prove causality. The field of sociology is incredibly complex and nuanced, and it's our job as sociologists to illuminate these shades of grey.\n",
